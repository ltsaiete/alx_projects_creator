## About the Project

This project uses web scraping to navigate trough the ALX Intranet and gather information to create the directory and files all the current projects at the ALX SE Programme.

## Why this repo?

Creating files for the projects in the ALX SE Program is such a repetitive task and sometimes it can be trick as you can have typos. Also, I often forget to create the READMEs for these projects, so I decided to automate this process.

## ALX SE Programme

The ALX software engineering program is an intensive 12-month program equipping you with the skills and network to become a front-end developer or back-end developer. It includes low- and high-level programming, algorithms, and databases. It also includes system engineering and networking. I'm currently enrolled to this program.
